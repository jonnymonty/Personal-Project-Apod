## Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

This is a C# WPF application that gets [Nasa's Daily Astronomy Picture](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) and displays it for you. You have the option to change the date to see previous pictures of the day. The app offers the ability to save the image to your computer as well as the ability to set it as your desktop background with a click of a button (setting background is only tested in windows 10).

## Project Status
The project is currently working and can be tested by following the installation and setup instructions below.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. 

Open with Visual Studio Code 2017 or higher > run the application

## Reflection

  - I started this project as a way for me to view older astronomy pictures of the day posted by Nasa.
  - Along the way of creating the application, I thought of some cool features that I could add, such as being able to save the image to my computer, and if I so choose, set it as my desktop background.
  - One of the main challenges I faced was parsing the html of [Nasa's APOD website](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) to find the image displayed.
